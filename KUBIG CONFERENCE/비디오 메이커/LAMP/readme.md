## Overview
This repository is based on the original **[LAMP](https://github.com/RQ-Wu/LAMP)** repository. While the original model focuses on learning motion, we have adapted it to learn **camera trajectories** by modifying the loss function and replacing the datasets.

### Key Modifications
- **Loss Function**: Adjusted to better suit camera trajectory learning.
- **Dataset**: Replaced the original dataset with one tailored for camera trajectory training.
